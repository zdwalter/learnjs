//Exercise 2: Comments And Pound Characters

// A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
// Anything after the // is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") // and the comment after is ignored

// You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
// print "This won't run."

print("This will run.")

//Find out if you were right about what the // character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).
//Take your ex2.js file and review each line going backwards. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.
//Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
//Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.
