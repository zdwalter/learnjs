//Above each line, use the // to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
//Remember in Exercise 0 when you started javascript? Start javascript this way again and using the above characters and what you know, use javascript as a calculator.
//Find something you need to calculate and write a new .js file that does it.
//Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. Find out why by researching what a "floating point" number is.
//Rewrite ex3.js to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate (hint: 20.0 is floating point).
